Typescript Recap
Typescript is not understood by browser but what browser does understands is javascript.
So basically Ts is a superset of Js which wraps up Js thus providing with extra functionality 
like strict type checking. Converting Ts into js happens behind the scene n this is what code transpiling 
known as. Thus, reducing the amount of bugs.

Responsiveness is taken into consideration from mobile point of view followed by
medium screens and then further larger screens

example :

<img className='hidden h-32 md:inline-flex lg:h-full' 

In the above example, the image is gonna hide for mobile screens and for medium and large screens it will maintain its aspect ratio accordingly
