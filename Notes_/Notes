Typescript Recap
Typescript is not understood by browser but what browser does understands is javascript.
So basically Ts is a superset of Js which wraps up Js thus providing with extra functionality 
like strict type checking. Converting Ts into js happens behind the scene n this is what code transpiling 
known as.

Responsiveness is taken into consideration from mobile point of view followed by
medium screens and then further larger screens

example :

<img className='hidden h-32 md:inline-flex lg:h-full' 

In the above example, the image is gonna hide for mobile screens and for medium and large screens it will maintain its aspect ratio accordingly
